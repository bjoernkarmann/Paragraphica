## **ðŸ“¡ Initial RPI setup**

set up SD card with **Raspberry Pi Imager** and make sure it is able to connect to the internet fot the initial setup. Then ssh into the device:

```
ssh pi@raspberrypi.local
```

password is: paragraphica

if that does not work run the nmap on your routers ip: 
```
nmap -sn 192.168.1.1/24
```
Find the ip adress for your pi, then ssh using the ip adress directly:

```
ssh pi@192.168.1.175
```

if you have *key varification failed* error, simply reset it and try again: 
```
ssh-keygen -R 192.168.1.175
```

## **ðŸ“¡ Setup WiFi Access Point**

Install the necessary software:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install dnsmasq hostapd
```

Then stop these services as we will configure them:
```
sudo systemctl stop dnsmasq
sudo systemctl stop hostapd
```

Create the virtual wireless interface by opening /etc/dhcpcd.conf:
```
sudo nano /etc/dhcpcd.conf
```
and then add the following lines to the end of the file: 
```
interface ap0
    static ip_address=192.168.50.1/24
    nohook wpa_supplicant
```
Save and exit.

The next step is to configure the DHCP server (dnsmasq). Move the default configuration file and create a new one:
```
sudo mv /etc/dnsmasq.conf /etc/dnsmasq.conf.orig  
sudo nano /etc/dnsmasq.conf
```
Then add the following to the new dnsmasq.conf:
```
interface=ap0
dhcp-range=192.168.50.50,192.168.50.150,255.255.255.0,12h
```
Save and exit.

Now, set up the access point. Create the hostapd configuration file:
```
sudo nano /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf
```
Add the following lines to this file:

```
interface=ap0
driver=nl80211
ssid=paragraphica
hw_mode=g
channel=7
wmm_enabled=0
macaddr_acl=0
auth_algs=1
ignore_broadcast_ssid=0
wpa=2
wpa_passphrase=starmole
wpa_key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
wpa_pairwise=TKIP
rsn_pairwise=CCMP
```

Modify /etc/default/hostapd to point to this configuration file:
```
sudo nano /etc/default/hostapd
```

Find the line #DAEMON_CONF="" and replace it with:
```
DAEMON_CONF="/etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf"
```
Save and exit. 

Enable and start hostapd and dnsmasq:
```
sudo systemctl unmask hostapd
sudo systemctl enable hostapd
sudo systemctl start hostapd
sudo systemctl start dnsmasq
```

enable IP forwarding. Open /etc/sysctl.conf:

```
sudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf
```

And uncomment this line: **net.ipv4.ip_forward=1**

Save and exit. 

The Raspberry Pi should now be set up to run a WiFi network on startup. However, we still need to create the ap0 interface on boot. For that, we need to add a line to /etc/rc.local:

```
sudo nano /etc/rc.local
```

Add this line before exit 0:
```
iw dev wlan0 interface add ap0 type __ap
```

Save and exit and reboot your Pi:
```
sudo reboot
```
You should be able to see "Paragraphica Connect" on your network list.

You can also check if wlan0 and ap0 are both on the list when running:
```
iwconfig
```

## **ðŸ’¾ Clone and Update Git Repository**

If not already installed then make sure you have git installed: 
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git
```

Clone the Paragraphica-v2 repository to the root

```
git clone https://github.com/bjoernkarmann/Paragraphica-v2.git
```

to update the git repository run: 
```
cd Paragraphica-v2
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/main
```
---
## **ðŸš¨ Prepare Project Requirements**

Enable SPI interface: 
```
sudo raspi-config
```
Then, navigate to "Interface Options" > "SPI" and select "Yes" to enable SPI.

Install pip3 and gps modules
```
sudo apt-get install python3-pip gpsd gpsd-clients
```
install the rest through pip3
```
sudo pip3 install flask gpiozero spidev requests luma.lcd pillow gpsd-py3
```

Now we can try run the wifi-connect.py to check if the captive portal appears when connecting to the network "Paragraphica Connect":
```
sudo python3 wifi-connect.py
```
---
## **ðŸ¥¾ Setup Boot Script**

Untested!

Create a new service file:
```
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/wifi-connect.service
```

And enter the following:
```
[Unit]
Description=WiFi Connect Service
After=network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /home/pi/Paragraphica-v2/wifi-connect.py
Restart=always
Environment=PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
Then, enable and start the service:
```
sudo systemctl enable wifi-connect
sudo systemctl start wifi-connect
```

You can check its status with
```
sudo systemctl status wifi-connect
```
